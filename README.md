✈️ Use Case 10: Priority Booking Processing (PriorityQueue - DSA)

📌 Overview
This use case implements a Priority Booking System using the PriorityQueue (Data Structure) concept in Java. It ensures that high-priority bookings (Express) are processed before normal bookings (Regular).

🎯 Objectives
Handle booking requests based on priority
Improve booking processing efficiency
Implement real-world queue management using DSA
🚀 Features
🔹 1. Priority Levels
EXPRESS → High priority (processed first)
REGULAR → Normal priority
🔹 2. Queue Management
Uses Java PriorityQueue

Bookings are added with:

Priority level
Timestamp (to maintain order)
🔹 3. Processing Logic
EXPRESS bookings are processed before REGULAR

If same priority → processed based on timestamp (FIFO)

Supports:

Add booking to queue
Process next booking
Process all bookings
🔹 4. Fair Processing
Ensures REGULAR bookings are not ignored
Maintains balanced processing
🧠 DSA Concept Used
PriorityQueue

Comparable Interface

Custom sorting:

Priority → First level sorting
Timestamp → Second level sorting
🏗️ Class Structure
📁 model
PriorityBooking

Stores booking, priority, timestamp
Implements Comparable
📁 service
PriorityBookingService

Manages queue operations
Handles processing logic
⚙️ Workflow
Create booking
Assign priority (EXPRESS / REGULAR)
Add booking to PriorityQueue
System sorts automatically
Process bookings in priority order
📊 Example Execution
Order of processing:

EXPRESS → User2
REGULAR → User1
REGULAR → User3
✅ Advantages
Faster processing for urgent bookings
Efficient queue handling
Real-world airline booking simulation
Demonstrates strong DSA knowledge
🔥 Integration
This use case is fully integrated with:

UC1–UC5 → Booking
UC6 → Modification
UC7 → Cancellation
UC8 → Flight Management
UC9 → Airport Management
🎉 Conclusion
Use Case 10 enhances the system by introducing priority-based booking processing, making the airline reservation system more efficient, scalable, and realistic.
